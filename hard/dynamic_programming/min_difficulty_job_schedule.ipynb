    "Minimum Difficulty of a Job Schedule\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint\n",
    "You want to schedule a list of jobs in d days. Jobs are dependent (i.e To work on the ith job, you have to finish all the jobs j where 0 <= j < i).\n",
    "\n",
    "You have to finish at least one task every day. The difficulty of a job schedule is the sum of difficulties of each day of the d days. The difficulty of a day is the maximum difficulty of a job done on that day.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given an integer array jobDifficulty and an integer d. The difficulty of the ith job is jobDifficulty[i].\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the minimum difficulty of a job schedule. If you cannot find a schedule for the jobs return -1.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: jobDifficulty = [6,5,4,3,2,1], d = 2\n",
    "Output: 7\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation: First day you can finish the first 5 jobs, total difficulty = 6.\n",
    "Second day you can finish the last job, total difficulty = 1.\n",
    "The difficulty of the schedule = 6 + 1 = 7 \n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: jobDifficulty = [9,9,9], d = 4\n",
    "Output: -1\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation: If you finish a job per day you will still have a free day. you cannot find a schedule for the given jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 3:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: jobDifficulty = [1,1,1], d = 3\n",
    "Output: 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation: The schedule is one job per day. total difficulty will be 3.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints:\n",
    "```\n",
    "1 <= jobDifficulty.length <= 300\n",
    "0 <= jobDifficulty[i] <= 1000\n",
    "1 <= d <= 10\n",
