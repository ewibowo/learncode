    "## Why Min-Heap Works\n",
    "\n",
    "The beauty of using a **min-heap** is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **We keep size = k**: Always maintain exactly k elements\n",
    "2. **Minimum at top**: The element with the *lowest* frequency is always at the root\n",
    "3. **Easy to evict**: When we encounter a more frequent element, we can easily remove the least frequent one\n",
    "4. **Efficient**: Each heap operation is O(log k)\n",
    "\n",
    "## What if we used a Max-Heap?\n",
    "\n",
    "With a max-heap, we'd keep the *least* frequent elements (opposite of what we want)!\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Max-heap would give us: [(1,4), (2,5)] after processing\n",
    "This would be the 2 LEAST frequent elements - WRONG! ❌\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Insight\n",
    "\n",
    "The min-heap acts like a **\"bouncer at a VIP club\"** with k spots:\n",
    "- Only the k most frequent elements get to stay\n",
    "- When someone more popular arrives (higher frequency), the least popular person (minimum frequency in heap) gets kicked out\n",
    "- Element 4 (frequency=1) tried to get in, but got kicked out because 5 and 7 are more frequent!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "return [5, 7]  # or [7, 5] - order doesn't matter\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Both 7 (appears 3 times) and 5 (appears 2 times) are the 2 most frequent elements. ✓"
