    "You are given an array of CPU tasks, each labeled with a letter from A to Z, and a number n. Each CPU interval can be idle or allow the completion of one task. Tasks can be completed in any order, but there's a constraint: there has to be a gap of at least n intervals between two tasks with the same label.\n",

    "Return the minimum number of CPU intervals required to complete all tasks.\n",

    "Input: tasks = [\"A\",\"A\",\"A\",\"B\",\"B\",\"B\"], n = 2\n",

    "```\n",
    "Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B.\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing task A, you must wait two intervals before doing A again. The same applies to task B. In the 3rd interval, neither A nor B can be done, so you idle. By the 4th interval, you can do A again as 2 intervals have passed.\n",

    "There are only two types of tasks, A and B, which need to be separated by 3 intervals. This leads to idling twice between repetitions of these tasks.\n",
